Among the temples of modern India which he designed, was a centre of excellence in the medical sciences. Nehru's dream was that such a centre would set the pace for medical education and research in Southeast Asia , and in this he had the wholehearted support of his Health Minister, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur.  The health survey and development committee ,chaired by Sir Joseph Bhore, an Indian Civil Servant ,had in 1946 already recommended the establishment of a national medical centre which would concentrate on meeting the need for highly qualified manpower to look after the nation's expanding health care activities . The dreams of Nehru and Amrit Kaur and the recommendations of the Bhore Committee converged to create a proposal which found favor with the government of New Zealand. A generous grant from New Zealand under the Colombo Plan made it possible to lay the foundation stone of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 1952.The AIIMS was finally created in 1956,as an autonomous institution through an Act of Parliament ,to serve as a nucleus for nurturing excellence in all aspect of health care.  All-India Institute of Medical Sciences was established as an institution of national importance by an Act of Parliament with the objects to develop patterns of teaching in Undergraduate and Post-graduate Medical Education in all its branches so as to demonstrate a high standard of Medical Education in India; to bring together in one place educational facilities of the highest order for the training of personnel in all important branches of health activity; and to attain self-sufficiency in Post-graduate Medical Education.

Whether it’s a location-aware audio tour, an interactive multimedia companion app, or something we dream up just for you, everything we do is in service of elevating the space—not our product.  Art Processors was born of a desire to connect with art in a deeper way: giving people the ability to absorb meanings and messages, to further interrogate artworks, and to enhance the emotional response, all without detracting or distracting from the pieces. That's why our primary technical focus is always on consistency and reliability of performance, so that our work never takes away from someone else’s aesthetic experience.  The enhancement of the emotional connection between a visitor and establishment as obtained at our flagship museum MONA has proven key to the ethos of Art Processors. We have achieved similar results providing tightly integrated experiences that enhance brand awareness and levels of visitor participation and enjoyment for clients including the Melbourne Zoo (i, Animal), State Library of New South Wales, Museum Victoria (WW1 Centenary exhibition), Australian War Memorial, Freer | Sackler and others.

Looking for a new job or trying to hire that critical person isn't fun. Finding the best opportunity and hiring the right person is more than an application and a resume. The hiring and interviewing process can be time consuming and tolling, which requires a trusted source to aid in communication, screening, preparation, scheduling, and feedback.   Averity is a team-based technology recruiting firm in New York City. Our strength and difference is that our teams are specialized in niche markets only in New York. Our niches include OpenSource and Web Engineering; Data Science; and DevOps, SysOps and Infrastructure. Our philosophy is: Find something you're good at, and do it better than anyone else.  Averity's difference is simple: We provide an unparalleled experience for everyone we interact with. We believe in a culture of world-class service. We take pride in our integrity in the recruiting industry. This is not a boiler room and there are no cubes.    Please read our reviews on Glassdoor, Google and Yelp.  Averity began out of the desire to create a different recruitment firm in New York City that not only provides the highest level of service to its clients and candidates, but also creates a positive team-oriented work environment where together everyone achieves more. The success is based heavily on the production of the team, not just the individual, creating a culture based on core values of Communication, Ethics, Innovation, Positive-Energy and Delivery.   There is a gap in connecting top tier talent within the Information Technology and Engineering sectors. As these industries continue to grow, the demand for a sophisticated web presence, monetization of data through business intelligence and a realizable return on online advertising will continue to increase. Averity will aim to fill a void left by other permanent placement and contract-staffing agencies.","2014","US","New York","NY","383 5th Ave","6th Floor","10016","Staffing & Recruiting","IT Staffing,DevOps,Recruiting,Full time placement,Contract staffing,Drupal,PHP,LAMP,Full Stack,Data Science,Web Engineering,SysOps",,"2021-08-30T16:16:30.424Z","2021-08-30T17:34:22.210Z","faff9af965f9c40a64cd95baf4917af1"
