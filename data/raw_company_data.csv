Among the temples of modern India which he designed, was a centre of excellence in the medical sciences. Nehru's dream was that such a centre would set the pace for medical education and research in Southeast Asia , and in this he had the wholehearted support of his Health Minister, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur.  The health survey and development committee ,chaired by Sir Joseph Bhore, an Indian Civil Servant ,had in 1946 already recommended the establishment of a national medical centre which would concentrate on meeting the need for highly qualified manpower to look after the nation's expanding health care activities . The dreams of Nehru and Amrit Kaur and the recommendations of the Bhore Committee converged to create a proposal which found favor with the government of New Zealand. A generous grant from New Zealand under the Colombo Plan made it possible to lay the foundation stone of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 1952.The AIIMS was finally created in 1956,as an autonomous institution through an Act of Parliament ,to serve as a nucleus for nurturing excellence in all aspect of health care.  All-India Institute of Medical Sciences was established as an institution of national importance by an Act of Parliament with the objects to develop patterns of teaching in Undergraduate and Post-graduate Medical Education in all its branches so as to demonstrate a high standard of Medical Education in India; to bring together in one place educational facilities of the highest order for the training of personnel in all important branches of health activity; and to attain self-sufficiency in Post-graduate Medical Education.

Whether it’s a location-aware audio tour, an interactive multimedia companion app, or something we dream up just for you, everything we do is in service of elevating the space—not our product.  Art Processors was born of a desire to connect with art in a deeper way: giving people the ability to absorb meanings and messages, to further interrogate artworks, and to enhance the emotional response, all without detracting or distracting from the pieces. That's why our primary technical focus is always on consistency and reliability of performance, so that our work never takes away from someone else’s aesthetic experience.  The enhancement of the emotional connection between a visitor and establishment as obtained at our flagship museum MONA has proven key to the ethos of Art Processors. We have achieved similar results providing tightly integrated experiences that enhance brand awareness and levels of visitor participation and enjoyment for clients including the Melbourne Zoo (i, Animal), State Library of New South Wales, Museum Victoria (WW1 Centenary exhibition), Australian War Memorial, Freer | Sackler and others.

Looking for a new job or trying to hire that critical person isn't fun. Finding the best opportunity and hiring the right person is more than an application and a resume. The hiring and interviewing process can be time consuming and tolling, which requires a trusted source to aid in communication, screening, preparation, scheduling, and feedback.   Averity is a team-based technology recruiting firm in New York City. Our strength and difference is that our teams are specialized in niche markets only in New York. Our niches include OpenSource and Web Engineering; Data Science; and DevOps, SysOps and Infrastructure. Our philosophy is: Find something you're good at, and do it better than anyone else.  Averity's difference is simple: We provide an unparalleled experience for everyone we interact with. We believe in a culture of world-class service. We take pride in our integrity in the recruiting industry. This is not a boiler room and there are no cubes.    Please read our reviews on Glassdoor, Google and Yelp.  Averity began out of the desire to create a different recruitment firm in New York City that not only provides the highest level of service to its clients and candidates, but also creates a positive team-oriented work environment where together everyone achieves more. The success is based heavily on the production of the team, not just the individual, creating a culture based on core values of Communication, Ethics, Innovation, Positive-Energy and Delivery.   There is a gap in connecting top tier talent within the Information Technology and Engineering sectors. As these industries continue to grow, the demand for a sophisticated web presence, monetization of data through business intelligence and a realizable return on online advertising will continue to increase. Averity will aim to fill a void left by other permanent placement and contract-staffing agencies.","2014","US","New York","NY","383 5th Ave","6th Floor","10016","Staffing & Recruiting","IT Staffing,DevOps,Recruiting,Full time placement,Contract staffing,Drupal,PHP,LAMP,Full Stack,Data Science,Web Engineering,SysOps",,"2021-08-30T16:16:30.424Z","2021-08-30T17:34:22.210Z","faff9af965f9c40a64cd95baf4917af1"

To sum up the opportunity: it’s an enormous addressable market, with highly attractive unit economics, where competition is deeply fragmented and notorious for delivering low-tech, subpar service.    Our digital & operational platform combines the sophistication of a technology company with the personal touch of a local business, rethinking property management from the ground up for performance, efficiency, trust, and delight.  By providing a seamless, full-service experience for owners and residents, we aim to make ownership worry-free and more profitable for the 25 million Americans who own rental homes. And in doing so, we become the operating system around our owners’ most valuable investments, as well as our residents’ homes.  Our leadership team has spent over a decade building digital platforms and operational machines that have powered hundreds of millions of dollars'​ worth of transactions for businesses like 1stdibs, Skillshare, and Warby Parker.  For a company that runs deep in high-growth tech & user-centric DNA, we also know what it means to manage large real estate portfolios at scale -- our teams have overseen tens of thousands of rental homes for some of the country's largest institutional owners of rental real estate.  We are based in Manhattan with local operations teams across the Southeast and Midwest.

We have been defining and refining the Market Intelligence Mix ever since, to offer our clients a unique perspective on the consumer landscape ahead and a clear roadmap with which to navigate it.  So what goes into the market intelligence mix?  MARKET RESEARCH is not the only thing we do, but it is right at the core of our business. The vast range of primary research we carry out and commission is the bedrock of our market intelligence, creating data series we can assess incrementally over the long term to track trends and forecast the future.  MARKET ANALYSIS is the second key element of the market intelligence mix. Our specialist team of market analysts scours the globe for trade, industry and government data, which our statisticians then integrate into meaningful sizing models and future value forecasts for thousands of sectors worldwide.  PRODUCT INTELLIGENCE adds micro-level relevance to the macro context of our market analysis, bringing our clients real-world examples of the launches and goods that are driving the numbers.  COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE is the fourth pillar of our work, keeping our clients abreast of their rivals’ strategies, communications and results, to give them the understanding they need to choose the right response to gain or maintain that crucial competitive edge.  The magic happens when we pull them all together. Trend analysts, category specialists, systems developers, dedicated account teams and client servicing staff work together to provide our clients with understanding as well as knowledge.  That’s our Market Intelligence. That’s how we help businesses grow. It’s why we’re the leaders in it.","1972","GB","London","England","4 Playhouse Yard",,"EC4V 5","Market Research","competitive intelligence,market intelligence,market research,consumer research,consumer trends,product trends,market reports,research reports",,"2021-08-30T16:16:30.424Z","2021-09-03T22:37:33.200Z","8ed946b552d5e64ce19edef866f55495"

Some of these new forms of mobility have incredible potential to make cities more sustainable and equitable, but for their development to be successful, cities must be able to work closely and confidently with the various operators.  Vianova platform helps cities to integrate all forms of mobility within their urban space, giving them easy and transparent access to the mobility data they need. Standards for compliance and mobility data specification (MDS) are gradually developing. Therefore our objective is to provide cities with a platform that allows them to facilitate the integration, comparison and analysis of this data as well as to monitor mobility operators'​ compliance with their local laws (fleet sizes, parking rules, traffic zones, etc.).  Our role as a trusted third party is essential for operators to be able to share their data securely and cities to keep control of their urban space while allowing citizens to benefit from these new means of transportation for more sustainable mobility.
